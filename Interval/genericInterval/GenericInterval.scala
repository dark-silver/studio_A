/*
 * The goal of this exercise is to practice generalization of an existing class.
 * This is a relatively normal refactoring procedure, when it is noticed that old code
 * can be used in a wider context than was initially planned.
 *
 * In the original exercise on round 3, the goal was to implement the class Interval which handled
 * a time interval between  two Moment objects. The exercise involved implementations for a number of methods including
 * union, intersection etc. which are common for intervals of any type.
 *
 * In this exercise, you will pull your old Interval class from naphtalene and create a
 * parameterized version GenericInterval[T] of it. The greatest part of the functionality offered by the Moment class
 * was related to comparing Moment objects, which was crucial for the proper functionality of the Interval class.
 * We will generalize this, too, by offering an Ordering[T] object with the Intervall class can perform exactly the same comparisons.
 * tarkalleen samat vertailut.
 *
 * One feature that Ordering[T] cannot offer, and which the original Interval class used,
 * is the distance between two "moments". This is conciously omitted in the GenericInterval[T] class.
 * The length was used only in the toString method anyway so does not affect any other methods.
